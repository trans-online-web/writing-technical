                        <h5><b>Referral Link</b>&nbsp;<small>Use this Referral link to earn some cash</small></h5>
                        <p>Earn $10 for every order made with your referral link.Refer as many people as possible</p>
                        <p>This is how this referral link works. Refer Someone into our website and get $10 every time your link is used to make the first order. If someone clicks on your link multiple times, our system will record only the first instance and the other instances will be ignored
                        </P>
                        <h5>What's a referral link and how does it work?</h5>
                        <p>Referral link is a module in Upwriters.net that rewards people for referring clients to our website. A bonus of $10 is credited on your account for every successful referral that has made an order on our system.</p>
                        <p>Once a user logs on the website through your link, a cookie is created and saved in the database. Even if the referred clears the cookies, you will still get your bonus, since that referral is still recorded in the database.</p>
                        <p>Referred can make an order years after referring them, you will still get your bonus because we have the records in the system.</p>
                        <h5>What if someone uses my link and does not order and goes back and uses someone else link, will I benefit?</h5>
                        <p>Yeah, if you are the first person to refer that user, you will get a commission when they make their first order. It does not matter how many referral links they click, the first referral link wins since they knew the system through the first referral link.</p>
                        <h5>Can I click on my referral link?</h5>
                        <p>You can do that for fun, your referral link does not affect.</p>
                        <h5>Where can I see my referral link analysis?</h5>
                        <p> From your dashboard, click on the referral section.</p>
                        <h5>I referred someone but the referral data did not reflect?</h5>
                        <p>This is because that person was referred by another person. That means the person already knows our website through another referral link, so your referral link will be ignored and reward the first person to refer them.</p>
